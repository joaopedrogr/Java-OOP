# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## üìò Description
The Java-OOP repository provides a structured approach to understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It is ideal for developers who want to learn or reinforce their skills in creating and working with Java classes, objects, and advanced OOP principles.

Key topics covered:

- Abstraction: Learn how to define abstract classes and methods.
- Composition: Understand how objects interact within a system.
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism: Apply core OOP principles through practical examples.
- Hands-on Exercises: Implement real-world scenarios to reinforce learning.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is organized to facilitate learning and experimentation:

### Main Files
## **src/**
This folder contains source code organized into key OOP concepts:

### **Abstraction/**
- Animal.java: Defines an abstract class with common attributes and behaviors.
- Mamifero.java: Extends Animal to showcase inheritance.
- Cachorro.java: Implements specific behaviors of a dog.
- TesteAbstrato.java: Demonstrates the usage of abstract classes.

### **Composition**
- Aluno.java: Represents a student entity in a school system.
- Carro.java - Motor.java: Demonstrate object composition in vehicles.
- Compra.java - Item.java: Simulate a shopping cart structure.
- Curso.java: Illustrates course management.
- CarroTeste.java - CompraTeste.java - CursoTeste.java: Contain test cases for the respective classes.

### **Encapsulation/**
- HouseA - HouseB: Demonstrate access control and encapsulation principles.

### **Inheritance/**
- Exercise: Contains inheritance-related exercises.
- Test: Demonstrates inheritance through test cases.

### **Polymorphism/**
- Includes examples showcasing method overriding and dynamic method invocation.

### **Exercises/**
- Exercise1 - Exercise4: Various hands-on tasks to practice OOP concepts.
